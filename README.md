# Identification-of-Good-loan-Bad-loan-using-Classification-Techniques
## Project Statement- 
A bank provides loans to their loyal customers. However, there are many customers who are not paying the instalments regularly and that is affecting the profit of a bank.
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how all parameters are defining if a loan is good or bad through classification techniques and give data-driven insights 
to the bank so that bank can implement strategies for business development.
## Classification Techniques used are-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Logistic Regression with Recursive Feature Elimination
3. Naive-Bayes Classification
4. Decision Tree Classification
5. Random Forest Classification
6. AdaBoost ensemble technique
7. Gradient Boosting technique
8. Xtreme Gradient Boosting technique
